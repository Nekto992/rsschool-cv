## About me:
My name is Mikhail, I'm 29 years old. I work for a manufacturing company engaged in the production and sale of building materials. Once I was assigned to work with our old site (www.vertragia.by), as I studied HTML at the university for half a year. My tasks included creating new pages, adding/removing banners and documents. I liked to do it and, realizing that now I'm doing basic things, I decided to develop further, move in this direction, since my current job does not bring me joy. So I signed up for the Front-End Development in RSSchool course.
